You probably obey most laws; however, you may not view some seriously enough to obey them. For example, you might be someone who is comfortable going faster than the posted speed limit. Is it all right to ignore some laws because they do not seem particularly important?

As an IT professional, you might feel that information security laws do not directly affect you and that you do not need to be familiar with them.
